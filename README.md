This repository showcases a **feature-based folder structure** for organizing a Flutter application, specifically designed for managing a shoe store.

### Key Features:

*   **Modular Architecture:** Each feature of the application is encapsulated in its own directory under `lib/features/`, allowing for better organization and separation of concerns.
*   **Assets Management:** All static assets such as images, icons, fonts, and videos are stored in the `assets/` directory, ensuring easy access and maintenance.
*   **Data Layer:** The `data/` directory contains repositories and services, which handle data management and external API interactions.
*   **Localization:** A dedicated folder for localization allows for easy implementation of multi-language support.
*   **Utility Functions:** The `util/` directory holds reusable utility functions that can be shared across various parts of the application.

### Folder Structure

The following illustrates the project structure, highlighting how the application is organized:
---

```

├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── videos/
│   ├── fonts/
│   └── logo/
├── lib/
│   ├── bindings/
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── styles/
│   │   └── widgets/
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── authentication/

│   │   ├── personalization/
│   │   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   │   ├── models/
│   │   │   └── views/
│   │   └── new_feature_as_u_like/
│   │       ├── controllers/

│   │       └── views/
├── data/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── services/
├── localization/
└── util/
```

This structure not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also allows for easier collaboration among developers working on different features simultaneously.
